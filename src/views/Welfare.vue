        <p><strong>AirTv takes the welfare of it's members very seriously.</strong></p>
        <p>
            However, our welfare process is only designed for issues relating to the operations of AirTv and does not cover the remit of personal welfare issues. For this we recommend seeking professional help, or asking the Uni / <a href="https://www.stirlingstudentsunion.com/advocacy-and-advice/student-advocacy-service/">Student Union for advice</a>.
            <br><br>
            This being said, we have a welfare form below which goes to our welfare officers. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScXHMzRRVHHCJzrqOwFS93BdB6C12mpfMrzb48ABIUzmJBY1w/viewform">Welfare Complaint Form</a>
