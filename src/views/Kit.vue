            One of the great advantages of being a member here at AirTv, <a href="https://www.stirlingstudentsunion.com/societies/6057/">(get your membership here)</a>, is that you are able to borrow our equipment. We have an array of cameras, sound recording equipment, tripods and more. Please find a full kit list and kit booking form below.
        </p>
        <p>Whilst we do lend out SD cards, we recommend that you purchase your own. This means that you won't accidentaly lose your data. They aren't expensive at Â£35 for a <a href="https://amzn.eu/d/aXLVMZm">pair of high quality 64GB cards like these</a>.</p>
